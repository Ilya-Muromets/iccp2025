                    Carl Vondrick is an Associate professor of computer science at Columbia University. His research focuses on computer vision and machine learning. By training machines to observe and interact with their surroundings, his group aims to create robust and versatile models for perception. They often develop visual models that capitalize on large amounts of unlabeled data and transfer across tasks and modalities. Other interests include sound and language, interpretable models and high-level reasoning. Recent work includes 3D reconstruction from shadows and thermal reflections.
